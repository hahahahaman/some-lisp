### lisp in small pieces

Following [Lisp in Small Pieces][LISP].

#### Approach

I've seen people recommend this book quite a bit, most memorably from this
[video][literate-programming] of Timothy Daly evangelizing the philosophy of
literate programming. The book has (in my opinion) quite dense explanation of
its code. I think it'll be much easier if I can just tinker with the
implementation, because tinkering is more engaging and feels more concrete. So,
I'm basing my code off already working repositories [this][squaremo-repo] and
[this][modern-repo]. And with that I'll try to follow along.
